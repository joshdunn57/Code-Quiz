# Code Quiz

***

During this challenge, I was given the task to create a timed coding quiz to a user. They were given a score based on how many questions they got right or wrong. After the quiz was over, the user was given input for their initials and their high score was stored inside a high score page. Each time they repeated the quiz, they can see their high scores and have the option to remove them.

## Work Completed

***

* Created several functions to start each question, to set the time, to check the question
* Made a timer for the user to take the quiz
* Coded multiple addEventListner functions to have the user click to go back, start game or clear scores.
